# GithubUsers-Angular

# Angular

This is a test project with Angular.

## Get started

### Clone the repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/jasuarez21/GithubUsers-Angular.git
cd github-users
```

### Install npm packages

Install the `npm` packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```shell
npm install
ng serve
```

The `ng serve` command builds (compiles TypeScript and copies assets) the application into `dist/`, watches for changes to the source files, and runs `lite-server` on port `4200`.

Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.
